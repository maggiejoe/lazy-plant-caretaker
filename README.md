## Motivation
This application idea came from a team member who loves house plants but understand how intimidating it can be to bring plants into your home or workspace and keep them alive. House plants have been proven to have so many health benefits in addition to bringing life to your decorative space, whether that be at home or at work.

We want to make it easier for you to find what plants will thrive in the conditions you have in your home or workspace. That way, you can have the best chance at keeping your plants alive and have the confidence to add more beautiful houesplants to your collection.

## Challenges

One of our biggest challenges was figuring out how to display the plants on the dashboard after the use selected the specfic criteria. With the help of TA's and lots of research, we were able to dynamically display the plant data that corresponded to the users selections. 

Another challenge we had was getting the sign-up and logout process working properly. Once we were able to get users to add to the user seeds, it was easier to write the javascript files to move the user along once they logged in, signed up, or logged out of the application.

## Future Development

Going forward, we have several ideas on how this application could grow to be more beneficial for the user. Below are a list of new ideas we would like to add to the applicaiton in the future.

* Adding a favorites section on the dashboard
    * When a user is presented with plants based off their selections, they have the option to save plants to a favorites section on their dashboard
    * This favorites section would only be displayed once the user selects plants to add to their favorites
* Adding public and private comments to their plants
    * We would like to give the user the ability to make comments about their specific plants on their own personal dashboard so they can keep track of their process of their plants
    * We would also like to add public comments where users can post public comments on each plant and allow users to interact with each other over their favorite plants through the comments
* Adding a web scrapper for plant tips and tricks
    * Where the tips section is on the dashboard and homepage, we would like to add a web scrapper that dynamically displays new links to websites and blogs associated with plant care every time the browser is refreshed
